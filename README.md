# Flame 3
Flame 3 is a Discord Bot, and a semi-rewrite sequel of Flame 2 (the first JavaScript/Discord.JS version of Flame) and Flame 1 (the very first version of Flame, programmed by my father 'MusicMaestro/Roy Penfold' and myself in Python 3/Discord.Py) to use Slash Commands API instead of the traditional message reading system.

I have no specific plans on where I will take this Discord Bot currently, but will probably work on it over time.
